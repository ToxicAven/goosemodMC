# GooseModMC

Automatically installs [GooseMod](https://goosemod.com), a Lightweight Discord client modification.
But its a Minecraft 1.17 Fabric mod. That installs it automatically. Everytime you start the game.


## Q&A

**How does this work?**
GooseMod is really freakin cool, in that it installs by pretending to be Discord's update API, and uses that to install its own updates. Pretty sweet.
This mod simply modifies the `settings.json` of discord clients with the URL of GooseMod's update system.

**What do I do with this?**
Install cool themes, install cool plugins, and turn off funny analytics from Discord. the [GooseMod Discord](https://goosemod.com/discord) can help you out.

**Supported OS?**
Windows, Linux, and the scary one Apple made.

**Bad code.**
Yes, I'm aware, I wrote this 3 energy drinks down and have never messed with json through java before.

**Why?**
Why not? I was bored and hyper.


*also the mod icon is from the GooseMod Discord server, thx!*
